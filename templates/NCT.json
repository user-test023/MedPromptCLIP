        "Smooth muscle pathology is characterized by qualitative descriptors such as well-defined borders, absence of necrosis, and homogenous texture, and quantitative metrics including lesion size typically less than or equal to 3 cm, low to moderate Hounsfield unit values, and standardized uptake values indicative of low metabolic activity..",
        "Smooth muscle pathology is characterized by qualitative descriptors such as spindle-shaped cells with sharp borders, lack of necrosis, and minimal edema, combined with quantitative metrics like lesion size typically ranging from 1 to 10 cm, low to moderate Hounsfield unit values, and standardized uptake values that are generally low on PET scans..",
        "The pathology appearance of smooth muscle, characterized by spindle-shaped cells with elongated nuclei, can be correlated with its underlying pathophysiology by observing features such as cellular necrosis, which presents as cell lysis and fragmentation; vascular proliferation, indicated by increased capillary density and endothelial cell hyperplasia; and fibrosis, seen as excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and collagen, each reflecting the tissue's response to injury, ischemia, or chronic inflammation..",
        "The pathology appearance of smooth muscle, characterized by features such as cellular hypertrophy, disarray, or degeneration, correlates with its underlying pathophysiology where cellular necrosis leads to loss of structural integrity, vascular proliferation results in increased blood supply and tissue growth, and fibrosis manifests as an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components, collectively contributing to altered tissue function and pathological remodeling..",
        "Pathological findings in smooth muscle, such as hypertrophy or dysfunction, can lead to clinical symptoms by affecting the contraction and relaxation processes of hollow organs and blood vessels, which may manifest as pain, neurological deficits, or respiratory compromise; for instance, hypertrophy of the airway smooth muscle can lead to asthma symptoms including respiratory distress..",
        "Pathological changes in smooth muscle, such as hypertrophy or dysfunction, can lead to clinical symptoms including pain from ischemia or spasms, neurological deficits from compression of nerves by enlarged muscles, and respiratory compromise due to impaired function of respiratory tract smooth muscles; for example, in asthma, smooth muscle hyperreactivity and hypertrophy can result in airway narrowing, causing difficulty breathing and wheezing..",
        "Smooth muscle pathology is characterized by spindle-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei, which contrasts with abscesses filled with neutrophils and necrotic tumors presenting with cell debris and ghost-like cells, while ischemic lesions exhibit coagulative necrosis with cell outlines preserved, differing from hemorrhagic lesions that show extravasation of blood and disrupted architecture..",
        "Smooth muscle tissue is distinguished by uniform spindle-shaped cells with minimal pleomorphism and a lack of prominent nuclear atypia, contrasting with the pus-filled cavities in abscesses, necrotic cellular architecture in tumors, and the distinct patterns of coagulative necrosis in ischemic lesions versus extravasated blood in hemorrhagic lesions..",
        "In pathology imaging, smooth muscle lesions typically demonstrate slow growth rates and gradual changes in contrast uptake, which generally correlate with a favorable prognosis due to their often benign nature..",
        "Temporal progression markers on pathology imaging for smooth muscle lesions, such as leiomyomas, often include slow lesion growth rate and variable contrast uptake changes, which generally suggest a benign prognosis but require monitoring for atypical features indicative of potential malignant transformation.."
